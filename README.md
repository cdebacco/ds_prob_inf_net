# Probabilistic inference in networks

## Description
Networks are a powerful tool to represent datasets with pairwise interactions between individual units.  Relevant examples are social networks, representing interactions between people, biological datasets as protein-protein interactions or gene-disease associations; financial transactions between institutions or companies.  
In this course, we will learn how to perform inference tasks in networked datasets, where the minimal input information is a list of edges.   

We will cover:  
- how to learn hidden patterns like community structure (or node clustering) or hidden hierarchies of nodes.  

We will use:  
- probabilistic methods
- inference techniques  (e.g. expectation-maximization and variational inference). 

## Learning Objectives.
By the end of this course, you should be able to:
1. LO1: **analyze** a networked dataset using probabilistic modeling
2. LO2: **infer** hidden patterns like clusters or rankings using statistical inference techniques for networks
3. LO3: **develop** a basic Phyton program to analyze a network dataset 
4. LO4: **evaluate** performance of different methods in inference tasks on networks
